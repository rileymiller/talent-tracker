# talent-tracker
This is a talent development tool that facilitates great conversations between employees and managers. First of many open source projects :P


******************CANARY BRANCH********************************************************

Used for trying new things. Shifting towards implementation of D3.js for improved rendering.

Canary branch is now up to speed with basic click/drag functionality. Also added a cool modal which we will use to prompt the user and bind data to the svg elements. Moving forward, the next steps will be to add the dynamic skill bar on the side of the talent tracker, presenting the skills in a queue-like format. When hovering over a skill, the skill data should be displayed somewhere (TBD, thinking of either a view box or a hover expansion box underneath the skill to display data), node on background should also become highlighted when skill is hovered over in the skill queue.
